Account 1 has overdraft protection, $0 fee to withdraw from the acc, and has an acc balance of $1 after the depositor deposits $1. The overdraft fee is $40.

 

a)     Client 1 withdraws $200 from acc 1. 1 -200 = -199. Since -199 is less than 0 and greater than or equal to -500, the overdraft fee is applied. Account balance = -199 - 40 = -239.

 

b)     Client 2 withdraws $100 from acc 1, the acc balance is -239-100 = -339. Since -339 is greater than or equal to -500 and the overdraft fee has already been applied by client 1, the overdraft fee is not applied here.


c)     Client 3 withdraws $161 from acc 1, the balance is -339-161 = -500. Since the balance is equal to -500 and the overdraft fee has already been applied by client 1, the overdraft fee is not applied here.

 

d)     Client 4 withdraws $490. -500 - 490 = -990. Since -990 is less than -500 and greater than or equal to -1000, the $40 overdraft fee is applied. -990 - 40 = -1030. However, after applying the overdraft fee, the value is less than -1000 and greater than or equal to -1500. Therefore, the overdraft fee would be applied again. The acc balance would finally be -1070.
